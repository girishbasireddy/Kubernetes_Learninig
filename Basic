Control Plane Components  :  

                              kube-apiserver,:  The main implementation of a Kubernetes API server is kube-apiserver. kube-apiserver is designed to scale horizontally
                               etcd :            Consistent and highly-available key value store used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data
                               kube-scheduler : Control plane component that watches for newly created Pods with no assigned node, and selects a node for them to run on..
                                kube-controller-manager : Control plane component that runs controller processes.
                                                          Node controller: Responsible for noticing and responding when nodes go down.
                                                           Job controller: Watches for Job objects that represent one-off tasks, then creates Pods to run those tasks to completion.
                                                            Endpoints controller: Populates the Endpoints object (that is, joins Services & Pods).
                                                            Service Account & Token controllers: Create default accounts and API access tokens for new namespaces
                                                            
Node Components  :  
                                 kubelet : An agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It makes sure that containers are running in a Pod
                                 kube-proxy : kube-proxy is a network proxy that runs on each node in your cluster, implementing part of the Kubernetes Service concept.
                                 Container runtime : The container runtime is the software that is responsible for running containers.
